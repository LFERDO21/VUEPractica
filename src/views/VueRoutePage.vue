    <h3>Vue Router</h3>
    <p>
      Vue Router is an official routing library for Vue.js applications. It provides a declarative and component-based way of managing navigation in a Vue application.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Vue Router, you can define different routes in your application and associate each route with a specific component. When the user navigates to a certain route, Vue Router takes care of displaying the corresponding component in the main content area of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some key features of Vue Router include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Declarative Routing: You can define your routes in a declarative format using the Vue.js syntax. This means you can specify which component should be shown for each route directly in your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Component-Based Routing: Each route is associated with a specific component. When the user navigates to a route, Vue Router automatically loads and displays the corresponding component.
      </li>
      <li>
        Route Parameters and Queries: You can define dynamic parameters in your routes, allowing you to create routes with variable values. Additionally, Vue Router makes it easy to handle route queries for capturing and manipulating additional data in the URL.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmatic Navigation: In addition to navigation through links or buttons, Vue Router provides methods for programmatically navigating. You can use these methods in your components to redirect the user to other routes or perform specific navigation actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nested Routing and Multiple Views: Vue Router supports nested routing, meaning you can have components that contain sub-routes and render in nested areas of the application. You can also configure multiple views routing, allowing you to display multiple components in different areas of the UI simultaneously.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In summary, Vue Router is a library that simplifies navigation and routing in Vue.js applications. It allows you to create routes, associate them with components, and handle navigation declaratively and programmatically. With Vue Router, you can build single-page applications (SPAs) and provide a smooth and dynamic navigation experience to users.
